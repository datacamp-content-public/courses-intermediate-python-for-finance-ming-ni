You've done a great job in for loops, congratulations!

In this lesson, we'll explore building different scenarios in a for loop.

`@script`
Imagine you are to invest in bonds...oh, not James Bond, but a corporate bond! 
You probably keep an eye on all the key data in a data frame, thinking that you've learned to plot, manipulate, and loop your data when needed. 
But one day the credit rating agencies downgrade your bond below investment grade. 
Are you skillful enough to handle the situation as good as James Bond? Let's take a look at the data frame first.

## For Loop over Data Frames

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0bc9bafbc5"
```

`@part1`
```Input:
In[1]: import pandas as pd
In[2]: df = pd.read_csv('bond.csv', index_col = 0) 

In[3]: for lab, row in df.iterrows():
           print(lab)
           print(row)

In[4]: plt.plot(df['Yield'], df['Price'])
In[5]: plt.show()```

{{1}} 


```Output:
Out[1]: 
0
Yield            0.02
Price            1539
Credit Rating     AAA
Name: 0, dtype: object
...
4
Yield            0.1
Price            877
Credit Rating     BB
Name: 4, dtype: object```

{{2}}


`@script`
You are very familiar with looping over data frames now. 

Print out row labels and row data and the output shows it iterates five times. 
Plot the yield and price columns.
You’ll see bond yield and price move reversely over time.

## If credit rating is downgraded...

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "387f9d5ce3"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Price of a 8%, 10yrs to maturity corporate bond with face value $1000 at different semiannual yields:

![](https://github.com/Jirehmountain/DataCamp/blob/master/Bond%20price%20and%20yield.png?raw=true)


`@script`
When credit rating agencies downgrade a bond’s rating to ‘ BB’, some financial institutions will immediately shun away due to strict rules not to invest in bonds rated below investment grade. 

You definitely wouldn't risk your money as well unless you feel comfortable with rising probability of default. 

You'd buy low, but only when the rating is higher than BB. However, Python can't recognize that BB is lower than AAA, so how can we make it work?

## Adding If

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "09d8ba4189"
```

`@part1`
- If statements are mutually exclusive{{1}} 

- Execute expression only if a condition is met{{2}} 

- Row[] to iterate in the loop{{4}} 

- df.loc[lab, 'new_column_name'] to add a new column{{6}}


`@part2`
```Inputs:
In[3]: for lab, row in df.iterrows():  
           if row['Rating'] != 'BB':
               print(row['Price'])
           else:
               df.loc[lab,'buy'] = 0
       print(df)

```
{{3}} 

```Outputs:
Out[1]: 
1539           
1324
1147
1000          
```
{{5}} 

``` Outputs:
Out[2]:
   Yield  Price Rating  buy
0   0.02   1539    AAA  NaN
1   0.04   1324     AA  NaN
2   0.06   1147      A  NaN
3   0.08   1000    BBB  NaN
4   0.10    877     BB  0.0
``` 
{{7}}


`@script`
Recall that if statements are mutually exclusively designed. 
In this case it means, a credit rating could be either ‘BB’, or one of the other entries in the rating column. 
It cannot be different entries at the same time, nor it can appear simultaneously in both if and else conditions. 
Therefore, setting if statements within a for loop is actually asking Python to execute expression only if a condition is met, otherwise forget it. 

Let’s set if condition by making row[‘ rating’] not equal to ‘BB’. That’ll leave only ' BB' in the else condition so let’s just say‘else’. 
Print out price column using row['Price'], see that Python loops only four times. 
For else condition, instead of a print, we add a new column using df.loc[lab, ‘ name of the new column’] equals zero because we would take no action at this price when a downgrade is announced. 

Check out the new data frame. You’ll see that a new column called ‘ buy’ has been added. The 5th entry is zero. All other entries are filled with‘NaN’.

`@part1`
- For loop with if/else structure in mutually exclusive way{{1}} 

- Understand iteration of variables in a for loop{{2}} 

- Print/Add new column/Plot in the loop
{{3}} 

```Inputs:
In[3]: for lab, row in df.iterrows():  
           if row['Rating'] != 'BB':
               plt.plot(row['Yield'], row['Price'], 'ro')
               plt.axis([0, 0.10, 0, 1600])
               plt.show()
           else:
               df.loc[lab,'buy'] = 0

In[4]: plt.plot(df['Yield'], df['Price'])
In[5]: plt.show()
```

`@script`
Great! You’ve learned how to construct if statements within a for loop, and you mastered iterating with row data in the loop. 
You have played with printing out looping results, and adding a new column to the data frame. 

A final note is that if we replace print with a plot of yield and price within the loop. 

Can you guess how many plots would there be? What actually would Python plot out?
