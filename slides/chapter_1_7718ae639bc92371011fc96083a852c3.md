## Imagine you invested in a Bond with face value...

![OR coupon(8%), 10yrs to maturity, face value($1000), yield, ratings...](https://github.com/Jirehmountain/DataCamp/blob/master/corporate-bonds2-1-638.jpg)


`@script`
Imagine you just bought a 10 year to maturity corporate bond that pays 8% coupon semiannually at face value $1000. You probably keep an eye on all the key data in a data frame, thinking that you've learned to manipulate and filter data, and you know how to loop over a dataframe when you need it. But suddenly, the credit rating agencies downgraded your bond below investment grade. What would you do so that you could rest assured just as James Bond confidently fulfills his tasks? Let's first take a look at the data frame.

## For Loop over Pandas Data Frame

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "e38e5c9183"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
```Input:
In[1]: df = pd.DataFrame(
            {'Yield': [0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10],
             'Price': [1539, 1324, 1147, 1000, 877],
             'Credit Rating':['AAA', 'AA', 'A', 'BBB', 'BB']})

In[2]: print(df)


In[3]: for lab, row in df.iterrows():
           print(lab)
           print(row)```


`@part2`
```Output:
Out[1]:
   Yield  Price Credit Rating
0   0.02   1539           AAA

```Output:
